# Uploading-sensor-data-to-IOTA-tangle

## Overview:

This is the repository of my end of dregree project wich consist in the following:
  
  - Collecting data from a sense HAT attached to a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
  - Sending data via MQTT to a Linux machine where there is installed a light weight IOTA wallet
  - Uploading data to the IOTA tangle

The aim of this project is to implement the increasingly demanded technology of the Internet Of Things. For this porpouse I have chosen the cryptocurrency IOTA as it provides a fast, secure, free and decentralized way of storing data.

## Collecting & Publishing Data

### What is Sense HAT?

Sense HAT is an add-on board specifically developed for Raspberry Pi and specially for the Astro-Pi competition. It has an 8x8 RGB LED matrix, five button joystick and includes the following sensors: 

      - Temperature
      - Humidity
      - Pressure
      - Gyroscope
      - Accelerometer
      - Magnetometer
     
It iss easily attached to the Raspberry Pi 3 via the GPIO ports, and secured with screws, as shown in the following pictures:
