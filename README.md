# Uploading-sensor-data-to-IOTA-tangle

This is the repository of my end of dregree project wich consist in the following:
  
  - Collecting data from a sense HAT attached to a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
  - Sending data via MQTT to a Linux machine where there is installed a light weight IOTA wallet
  - Uploading data to the IOTA tangle

The aim of this project is to implement the increasingly demanded technology of the Internet Of Things. For this porpouse I have chosen the cryptocurrency IOTA as it provides a fast, secure, free and decentralized way of storing data.
